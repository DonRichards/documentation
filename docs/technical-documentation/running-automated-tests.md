# Running Automated Tests
 
## User Interface

To run automated tests via a web browser, you can to Admin > Configuration > Testing 
(http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/testing) in the admin toolbar.  From 
there you can browse and search for tests, select the ones you'd like to run.  Pressing
the blue "Run Tests" button will execute all tests you've selected in a batch and then
display the results.
